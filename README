Here is our write-up for the final project flight path program.

=========== Part A: MinMaxer for triangulation ==============

For triangulation we used the Delaunay1 algorithm on the given heightfield. We found it to be sufficiently fast for our purposes and noticably faster than the minmaxSlope despite no visual difference. Some of the other choices were not used due to them ignoring the z-value. The Delaunay1 (Lawson Flip) was chosen over the Incremental Flip version also because of speed (as desicribed in the MinMaxer documentation) while giving good results.

Interfacing with MinMaxer involved modifying their sample files to read in our given heightfield data and then modifying a triangle printing function to dump the generated triangles to a data file. These values are then read into our program on launch and used to generate a Terrain class which assembles the data into a uniform grid for efficient collision detection and adds texture coordinates so we can map a Google Maps image of the area onto the terrain.

============= Part B: Planning a Smooth Tour  ===============

To compute our tour we used the previously attained triangulation data, a loaded list of points of interest (POIs) and a math engine capable of detecting collisions on the terrain with points, line segments, and bezier curves. Our algorithm proceeded as follows:

Initialize a control point midway between each POI and raised a fraction of the total length of the distance between the control points

For each POI p except the first and last:
  Get the midway control point cp0 previous to p
  Get the midway control point cp2 following p
  Form a plane P with the points cp0,p,cp2
  Create vectors v1=(p-cp0).normalize and v2=(p-cp2).normalize
  Expand a triangle from point p which lies in plane P with the given constraints:
    One vertex t1 lies in the line p+(v1+v2)*a where a is a scalar
    One vertex t0 lies in the line segment from t1 to cp0
    One vertex t2 lies in the line segment from t1 to cp2
    t1 and t2 are equidistant from t0
    p lies in the center of t0,t1,t2
  Place control points at t0, t1 and t2
  if collision is detected or curvature is extreme:
     Move control points cp0 and cp2 up in the air or away from each other and recursively perform this same algorithm on their adjacent POI

endFor

For the first and last POI:
    set a control point at the POI
endFor

The reasoning behind this algorithm is that it is generally safest for a flight to never go lower than it absolutely has to, hence the POI should be the lowest points on the local curve. To ensure this a bezier curve is formed around each POI such that the lowest point intersects the POI. One way to accomplish this is to form a triangle around the POI with the POI lying the the center of it so if the triangle's vertices were control points of a bezier curve, the curve would intersect the POI at t=0.5 interpolation. In order for this to work out, an additional control point must be added between each pair of POI so there is a longer "travel curve" between each pair of POIs and a shorter "dive curve" around each POI. 

The algorithm is essentially a way to effeciently construct these requirements by looking at a single POI and the two adjacent "travel curve" control points at a time. The rest of the algorithm arises naturally from ensuring C1 continuity and staying within particular fixed planes.

To avoid collisions, we detect collisions along the candidate bezier curves of each POI and the following "travel curve." Collisions are effeciently found with the aid of a uniform grid spatial data structure. If collisions are found we adjust the positions of the midpoint control points since raising them generates a more dramatic dive for the adjacent control points and allows the flight to move over more obstacles. The control points are then re-evaluated for each adjacent POI. Similarly, extreme curvatures are handled by detecting when a curve creates a curvature greater than a specified minimum, and if so the mid control points are moved away from each other so there is more space between control points and a gentler curve.

We used a d=100 size bounding cube of region to collide with as a valid hit with the POI.

=============== Part C: Viewing the Tour ====================

We created our program using GLUT to offer capabilities of animation, user input, and multiple views. We render our terrain using a texture map we obtained from Google Maps and warped in photoshop to align with the given data. Multiple views can be toggled including a minimap showing an overall view of the area. Additionally points can be added and removed by interacting with the command line.

Our animation is done by evaluating the bezier curves in order and using gluLookAt to set the current position as a position on the curve and the point to look as a point a little further ahead of the current point. This gives a roller coaster effect and is pretty fun. A top-down orthographic minimap is provided to visualize the global progress of the camera. We render the POIs as multiple colored boxes and additionally render each control point with a green box to better visualize the construction of the quad.

============== Part D: On the Fly Changes ===================

Our algorithm constructs the path by iterating through the POIs and locally constructing the control points around the POI. Hence to remove a POI we need only remove it and then reconstruct the two adjacent POIs. To add a POI we add a new midpoint and construct the two new path segment surrounding the new POI and reconstruct the previous two adjacent POIs (since their midpoints relative to the now moved point have changed).

========== Part E: Tours for Unordered Sites ================

Since our algorithm for planning a smooth tour described in Part B is guaranteed to work between any sight, our method to find the optimal path for all sights uses euclidean distance. The method can be described the following way:

  pick a starting point A
  add A to a ordered list
  find point B with the minimum distance from point A
  add B to the ordered list
  find point C with the minimum distance to point B from points who are not yet in the ordered list
  ..
  ..
  until all points have been added to the ordered list

We simply try all sight points as starting points and the one who produces the smallest total length of the sight tour is picked as the final starting point. This method is not close to any global solution of the general Traveling Salesman Problem but it works very well for the given data in this assignment. The major drawback of this method is that we can be unlucky and in the end only have remaining points that are very far from each other.

========== Part F: Metrics ==================================

Total length:	182622 units
Minimum vertical distance: 54.2 units
Maximum curvature: 0.27 units
Number of distinct curves: 27

The measurements are done by evaluation at a certain number of points for each curve segment. To make sure that accuracy is adequate, the stepsize has been gradually lowered until the values start to converge at a satisfactory rate.
